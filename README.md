# bitcoin-whitepaper-Amharic-translation

 The Amharic translation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin whitepape : In this Document i've translated Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin whitepaper into Amharic [ .amh ]. By making this foundational document accessible to more people here in Ethiopia, we are aiming to foster the adoption and understanding of Bitcoin in Ethiopia. Feel free to explore the translated whitepaper and share it with others.

To enhance understanding, i’ve taken an extra step: adding translated words at the end of page. These annotations provide context for critical English terms used in the whitepaper.
For instance, when Nakamoto discusses “proof of work,” i’ve included equivalent Translated word [ የጥረት ማረጋገጫ / ጥረት ላይ የተመሰረተ ማረጋገጫ ] . This way, readers grasp both the concept and its linguistic nuances.
